# Utilizing Deep Learning Models for Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Photovoltaic Modules to Improve Solar Energy Constructionsâ€™ O&M Activities Quality - A Case Study

This code repository is based on a chapter from Information Systems Research in Vietnam Book by Khuong Nguyen-Vinh and Huynh Vo et al. The data used in this study is from Buerhop-Lutz and Deitsch et al. 

## Installation and Setup
### Anaconda
1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repo, then create a virtual environment called `is_elpv` using conda:
```
